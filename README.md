*A script I cooked up that compiles all of your playlist's songs to a single playlist.*

Simply change the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` variables to the values corresponding with your Spotify bot client.

If you'd like, you may choose to increase `MAX`. The higher the `MAX`, the more playlists and songs the script will capture and add to the new playlist. However, it is very unlikely you have over 1000 playlists...

**You may randomly get a `Insufficient client scope` error. This is fault of Spotify's API and not the program.`
